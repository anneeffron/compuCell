Welcome to CompuCell3D
CompuCell3D is a flexible scriptable modeling environment, which allows the rapid construction of sharable Virtual Tissue in-silico simulations of a wide variety of multi-scale, multi-cellular problems including angiogenesis, bacterial colonies, cancer, developmental biology, evolution, the immune system, tissue engineering, toxicology and even non-cellular soft materials. CompuCell3D models have been used to solve basic biological problems, to develop medical therapies, to assess modes of action of toxicants and to design engineered tissues. CompuCell3D intuitive and make Virtual Tissue modeling accessible to users without extensive software development or programming experience.

It uses Cellular Potts Model to model cell behavior. Below is a preview of what CC3D can do:

This project is currently funded by generous support from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH). Grants: NSF- 1720625, “Network for Computational Nanotechnology - Engineered nanoBIO Node” and NIH- R01 GM122424, “Competitive Renewal of Development and Improvement of the Tissue Simulation Toolkit”.

Compucell3D is led by Anwar Shaikh (IU), Maciej Swat (IU) and James Glazier (IU) in collabration with Dr. David Umulis (PU) and team.


Want to contribute to CompuCell3D developement?
We highly encourage fellow researchers to contribute to CompuCell3D code. If you have developed some useful plugin or fuctionality on CompuCell3D and would like share it with rest of us. Please commit the code and open a pull request on CompuCell3D GitHub repository. We would love to see it in next version of CompuCell3D.
